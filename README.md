# todo_list_with_api

Hey Edinburgh folks!

I've started this off in django, if you are unfamiliar with Django please try the django project tutorial - I thought it was fab.

To run:
* Clone this repo. 
* `python manage.py migrate`
* `python manage.py runserver`
* Open localhost:8000 in your fav. browser, appricate the lack of css!
* Go back to the console and ctrl-c to stop the server. Create a user for yourself using  `python manage.py createsuperuser`
* Start the server and go to localhost:8000/admin and start exploring the models. Create some lists and elements...
* Go to localhost:8000/todo and you should be able to see a list of the instances you just created.
