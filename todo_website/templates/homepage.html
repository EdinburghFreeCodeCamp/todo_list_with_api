<h1>Welome!</h1>

<p>This is my latest project. A simple 'todo' website with an api integration.</p>
<p>You can start by creating a project, like "design a todo website", and add tasks to it, like "create css for headings". When you have finished the task you can tick it off in the browser or on your command line.</p>
<p>I'd like to call myself a developer. So being able to commit work and then tick it off my to do list is my main reason for starting this.</p>

<p>Let me know how you get on!</p>


<h2>Oh! BTW. this isn't finished yet.</p>
